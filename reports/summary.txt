SOC Home Lab - Summary Report

This project demonstrates core SOC analyst skills using a home lab with:
- Splunk SIEM
- Log forwarding from Windows (via Winlogbeat + Sysmon)
- Log forwarding from Linux (via rsyslog)
- Simulated attacks (SSH brute-force) from Kali Linux

Confirmed logs:
- Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, System)
- Sysmon logs
- Linux syslogs

Attack Simulated:
- SSH brute-force from Kali to Ubuntu
- Detected via Splunk search queries

Next Steps:
- Add more detection rules
- Set up alerting in Splunk
- Write incident response playbooks
